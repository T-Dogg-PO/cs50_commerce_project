# cs50_commerce_project
Project 2 for Harvard's CS50 Web Development course

For this project we created a basic auction website. Users should be able to create listings of items they are selling, and other users can bid on said items. The full specifications for this project can be found here - https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/

Although all of the specified functionality should be implemented in my code, what I have written is likely not best practice and I would appreciate any input for improvements or things I can do differently. At this stage I may return to make improvements to this site in the future (in particularly the styling).
